			<p> I make art for the people I love. This work is about the greatness of communities, and so it is about people loving each other. The true nature of a community comes out when there is a necessity for everyone to overcome something together, and people help their neighbors as well as strangers. Kindness grows inside of helpful interactions, leaving trust and connection between people in the places it has been, something we could use a lot more of in our online age. There is beauty in selflessness and duty which is not as integrated into our daily lives as it once was. In viewing this piece, I hope you may have a chance to reflect upon those in your communities, and those in communities that have come before you.

				I draw a lot for this project from my own home communities in the East Coast, especially boating and seaside communities. Folk tales and songs have been passed down telling of experiences, jokes, and cautionary tales, manifesting usually in largely seabound motifs. Hopefully communities like those who would be called upon in storms to save passengers washed ashore will (like the Mary Ellen Carter) rise again.

						This artwork was fully conceptualized and created by me, featuring a custom-designed and handcrafted 3ft by 3ft frame tailored specifically for this piece. I programmed a bespoke LED strip using Arduino to create dynamic light patterns that respond to interaction. Capacitive sensors are integrated into the frame to detect the presence of hands, fostering a tactile, interactive experience. All graphics, electronics, and coding were meticulously developed by me to bring this vision to life, merging technology and craftsmanship into a cohesive, immersive artwork.</p>
