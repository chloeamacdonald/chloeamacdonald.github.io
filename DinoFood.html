			<p>Created in collaboration with the Ontario Science Center, the installation “Ahh! I’ve Been Eaten by a Dino!” is an interactive, multi-sensory experience geared towards children and families. My team wished to create a large-scale immersive project to explain the diets of carnivorous, vegetarian and omnivorous dinosaurs. As a walk through experience, guests were invited to explore the installation at their own pace, discovering information about dinosaurs as their presence triggered sound and light displays along with text and tactile graphics. </p>
			<p>The installation was exhibited in the Ontario Science Center from December 7th, 2023 until December 11th, 2023. </p>
