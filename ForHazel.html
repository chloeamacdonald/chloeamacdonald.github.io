			<p> For Hazel is a kinetic sculpture inspired by my fascination with motion and mechanical systems, as well as my personal connection to the traditions of folk art from Canada’s East Coast. The piece features a handcrafted wooden frame with layered waves in motion, driven by a custom cam mechanism I designed and fabricated. Using hand-painted details and tactile materials, the work evokes a nostalgic and handmade aesthetic, reflecting my family’s history and heritage. Dedicated to my great-grandmother, Hazel, and the lighthouse built in her honor, the piece celebrates the love and stories that shape our lives, blending technical precision with heartfelt craftsmanship.</p>

			<h2>Process</h2>

			<div class="process-statement">
				<p> This piece was created through a process of designing and fabricating a custom cam mechanism, handcrafting and painting the wooden components, and iteratively refining prototypes to achieve cohesive motion and a tactile, folk-inspired aesthetic.</p>

			<div class="process-details">

					<p> Initial prototypes were hand-cut and focused on understanding the fundamentals of cam systems. While these early versions were unsuccessful, they provided valuable insights into the need for precise guides and alignment. Moving forward, I introduced laser-cut components to improve accuracy and stability, which became essential as I transitioned from single-cam experiments to a multi-cam system for synchronized movement.</p>
					<p> Each iteration brought new challenges, from ensuring smooth operation to balancing the handcrafted aesthetic with the mechanical demands of motion. Through repeated testing and adjustments, I refined the layered wave design and created a cohesive system that worked reliably. This process deepened my understanding of mechanical systems and highlighted the importance of patience and planning, culminating in a piece that blends engineering and storytelling with a deeply personal narrative.</p>
